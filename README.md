# Linux-Shell

Developed a shell on Linux by taking in 10 different user commands from the terminal and executing/interpreting them as if they were Linux commands by utilizing processes, pipes (for processes to communicate with each other), and dup2 (to redirect input/output) system calls in c

executor.c - Main file that contains the code that executes the unix commands
